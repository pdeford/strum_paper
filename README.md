## StruMs: A flexible and extensible model of TF-DNA interactions

This GitHub repository is associated with the paper _StruMs: A flexible and extensible model of TF-DNA interactions_ by P. DeFord and J. Taylor, and reproduces all of the analysis and figures from that paper.

This analysis relies heavily on the **StruM package**. Source code, installation instructions, and documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/pdeford/StructuralMotifs).

In addition this analysis has the following dependencies:

* Python 2
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - scipy
    - pandas
    - bx-python
    - biopython
    - scikit-learn
